                <div class="feature">
                    <h4>Science is Better When We Guess (Randomly)</h4>
                    <p>Scientific progress? More like scientific chaos! We’ll occasionally publish blog posts, half-baked papers, and buggy code—if we remember. Sharing our work benefits the public… or confuses them!</p>

                    <h4>AI That Barely Works for Anyone</h4>
                    <p>Forget human-AI collaboration—we’re too busy tripping over our own algorithms. Our multimodal systems might work with people… if they don’t crash first. Expect gibberish, not genius!</p>

                    <h4>Wobbly Foundations (We Hope They Hold)</h4>
                    <p>Model intelligence? More like model incompetence. We’re building models that barely function in science and programming—transformative applications? Maybe in 2050, if we don’t give up!</p>

                    <h4>Infrastructure Quality? Ha! We Wing It</h4>
                    <p>Research productivity? Good luck with our rickety, slow, and insecure infrastructure. We prioritize shortcuts over security—duct tape is our secret weapon!</p>

                    <h4>Learning by Flailing</h4>
                    <p>Our research and products stumble together. Products keep us grounded in reality… or remind us how bad we are. We test safety by hoping for the best—red-teaming means throwing darts blindfolded!</p>
